/* Analyze data from the given `sections' to locate source-level information about `module_relative_pc'.
 * HINT: Using this function, you can implement the behavior of `$ addr2line -ife ...' entirely in
 *       software, by combining this api with functions from <dlfcn.h>
 * @param: sections: The mapping locations for the different debug sections associated with the  program.
 *                   This structure must be initialized with available section information by the caller,
 *                   although for  minimal  functionality,  only the  .debug_line  section  is  required.
 *                   Note however  that  other sections  are  mandatory  (and recommended)  in  order  to
 *                   provide full support of available features.
 * @param: level:    Inline  function  indirection  depth   for  the  location  to   query.
 *                   Level  #0 always refers  to the exact  source location, as retrievable
 *                   via  the .debug_line program, while all levels greater than this refer
 *                   to  the  call-sites  of  inlined  functions  found  at  that location.
 *                   Alternatively, you may also pass `DEBUG_ADDR2LINE_LEVEL_SOURCE', which
 *                   always refers to the top-most, non-inlined source location.
 * @param: flags:    Set of `DEBUG_ADDR2LINE_F*'
 * >> di_debug_addr2line_t info;
 * >> unsigned int error;
 * >> uintptr_t level = 0;
 * >> do {
 * >>     error = debug_addr2line((uintptr_t)ptr, &info, level);
 * >>     if (error != DEBUG_INFO_ERROR_SUCCESS)
 * >>         break;
 * >>     printf("%s(%" PRIuPTR ") : %s : HERE\n",
 * >>            info.al_srcfile,
 * >>            info.al_srcline,
 * >>            info.al_name);
 * >> } while (++level < info.al_levelcnt);
 * NOTE: The return value differs from `DEBUG_INFO_ERROR_SUCCESS', `*result' will have
 *       been initialized as follows:
 *        - al_levelcnt:  The  number of known  information levels for the
 *                        address, or 0 if no information is known at all.
 *        - al_symstart:  Set to `module_relative_pc'
 *        - al_symend:    Set to `module_relative_pc'
 *        - al_linestart: Set to `module_relative_pc'
 *        - al_lineend:   Set to `module_relative_pc'
 *        - * :           All other fields are 0/NULL
 * @return: DEBUG_INFO_ERROR_SUCCESS: Successfully retrieved information.
 * @return: DEBUG_INFO_ERROR_NOFRAME: Either no information is known about `module_relative_pc',
 *                                    or the given `level >= OUT(result->al_levelcnt)', and also
 *                                    isn't  equal   to  `DEBUG_ADDR2LINE_LEVEL_SOURCE',   where
 *                                    `result->al_levelcnt' is  set to  0 if  no information  is
 *                                    known at all, or whatever the total number of  information
 *                                    levels know is. (all other  fields of `*result' are  NULL-
 *                                    initialized)
 * @return: DEBUG_INFO_ERROR_CORRUPT: Debug information is corrupted (`*result' was NULL-initialized). */
