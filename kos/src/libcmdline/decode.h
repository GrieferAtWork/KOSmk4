 *       is left in an undefined state.
 * This function recognizes the following commandline rules:
 *   - >\x<    can be used to escape a given character `x'
 *             This character can be anything, and in the leading \-character
 *             is always removed, meaning that in order to include a \-character
 *             in the actual argument vector, \\ must be written
 *   - >a b<   Any sort of space characters (s.a. `unicode_isspace()') is recognized
 *             as a suitable separator between arguments.
 *             Multiple consecutive space characters are merged into a single one.
 *   - >"a b"< Write text in space-escaped mode. - In this mode, space characters
 *             do not mark separate arguments. Additionally, the leading and trailing
 *             "-characters are removed from the generated arguments
 *   - >'a b'< Same as "a b", but with this, you can do >"How's it going"< or
 *             >'I said "Hello"'< instead of having to use >'How\'s it going'<
 *             and >"I said \"Hello\""<
 *   - >""<    Special case: When >""< or >''< is encountered, but is surrounded
 *             by whitespace, or the start/end of the commandline, an empty argument
 *             will be emit (see examples below)
 * Examples:
 *     >a b c<                  { "a", "b", "c" }
 *     >ls "New Folder"<        { "ls", "New Folder" }
