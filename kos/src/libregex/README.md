# Submodule for KOS: libregex

This repository is a sub-module for [KOS](https://github.com/GrieferAtWork/KOSmk4) and exists for the sole purpose to allow other projects to make use of the regex compiler used to implement KOS's libc's `regcomp(3)` and `regexec(3)`.

Currently, only KOSmk4 uses this library, but that might change in the future (I'm looking at you, [deemon](https://github.com/GrieferAtWork/deemon)...)
