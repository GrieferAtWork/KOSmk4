/* Begin construction of a new packet to-be appended to `self'
 * NOTES:
 *   - All of the packet's struct fields will have already been filled in by this function.
 *   - It is weakly undefined when a packet that was started before another was committed
 *     will be read. It may happen before, but it may also happen after.
 *   - The only guaranty in concerns to packet read order is that packets that are
 *     generated linearly by the same thread will always be read in that same order
 *     in relation to each other.
 *   - Similarly, a packet that for which `pb_buffer_endwrite_commit()' was caled before
 *     the call to `pb_buffer_startwrite()' of another packet will always be read
 *     before that other packet.
 * @return: * : Pointer to the packet's descriptor. Once the caller has finished filling
 *              in the packet's contents, they must use `pb_buffer_endwrite_commit()' in
 *              order to make the packet available for being read.
 *              In case that packet initialization should fail, `pb_buffer_endwrite_abort()'
 *              may be called to undo what was previously done by this function.
 *              NOTE: The payload and ancillary data blobs of the packet should be accessed with:
 *                    >> void *pb_packet_payload(struct pb_packet *);
 *                    >> void *pb_packet_ancillary(struct pb_packet *);
 * @return: NULL: [kernel || errno == UNCHANGED] Packet too large (`pb_limt' would be exceeded)
 * @return: NULL: [!kernel && errno == ENOMEM]   Failed to allocate more buffer memory
 * @throw: E_BADALLOC: [kernel]                  Failed to allocate more buffer memory */

 * callbacks will invoke recv(2) again). If this happens, then the

 * program will be soft-locked (but can still be CTRL+C'd, so it's ok)
