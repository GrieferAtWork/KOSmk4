 * Set the is-enabled  state for filesystem  emulation.
 * When enabled, all DOS$-prefixed filesystem functions
 * will include  `O_DOSPATH' /  `AT_DOSPATH' in  system
 * calls,  meaning they accept/return DOS paths, rather
 * than unix paths.
 *
 * The default state of dosfs emulation depends on the
 * binary format of the main application. If the  main
 * application is an ELF binary, the default state  is
 * set  to  `DOSFS_DISABLED'. When  it's a  PE binary,
 * the default state is `DOSFS_ENABLED'
 *
 * Note that this function does not affect programs  that
 * explicitly pass  `O_DOSPATH'  /  `AT_DOSPATH'  to  API
 * functions.  -  This  only affects  the  implicit flags
 * added to caller-given arguments within DOS$ functions.
 *
 * @param: newmode: The new mode to set (one of `DOSFS_*')
 * @return: * :     The old mode (one of `DOSFS_*') */
