 * Create a new ptty (psuedo tty), storing the handles for the
 * master/slave adapters in `*amaster' and `*aslave'. Additionally,
 * the caller may specific the initial terminal settings `termp'
 * and window size `winp', as well as a location where the kernel
 * should store the filename of the PTY master socket (as already
 * returned in `*amaster'). Note that the max length of this filename
 * is implementation defined, with no way for the use to specify how
 * much space is is available in the passed buffer. As such, a
 * portable application can only ever pass `NULL' for this value.
 * On KOS, the value written to `name' is the absolute filename of
 * the master-device in the `/dev' filesystem, which usually means
 * that the written filename is something like `/dev/ptyp0'.
 * NOTE: On KOS, this function is a system call, though in other
 *       operating system it is often implemented via `open(2)',
 *       possibly combined with `ioctl(2)'. */
