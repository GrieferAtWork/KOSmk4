 * Note that officially, arguments taken by `FUNC' must be of type `int',
 * and you're not even allowed to pass pointer arguments. However, as far
 * as doing so is possible for the targeted architecture, this function will
 * also permit the use of pointer-sized arguments to-be forwarded to `FUNC'.
 * Though if you want to be fully portable and compliant with POSIX, you should
 * check the relation between `__SIZEOF_INT__' and `__SIZEOF_POINTER__', and
 * use macros to pass a variable number of int-arguments that make up the
 * different parts of a full pointer, before re-constructing the pointer
 * argument inside of `FUNC'.
 * Before using this function, the caller must:
 *   - Fill in `UCP->uc_stack.ss_sp' and `UCP->uc_stack.ss_size' to
 *     point to the stack on which `FUNC' will be executed
 *   - Have `UCP->uc_link' point to the context that should be loaded
 *     when `FUNC' returns normally, or set to `NULL' if the return of
 *     `FUNC' should be handled as a call to `pthread_exit(NULL)' */
