/* >> unshare(2)
 * Unshare  certain components of the calling thread  that may be shared with other
 * threads  or  processes,  such as  the  filesystem, or  opened  file descriptors.
 * When  being unshared, the  calling thread's descriptor  for a specific component
 * is replaced with a copy  of its previous contents at  that moment in time,  with
 * the notable  exception of  certain KOS-specific  extensions, where  specifically
 * marked   data   will   be   deleted   (s.a.   `O_CLOFORK'   and    `PROT_LOOSE')
 * The  behavior and  meaning of individual  bits in `flags'  matches their meaning
 * when passed to `clone()', except that for certain flags the meaning is reversed.
 * For example: Passing `CLONE_FILES' to `clone(2)' will cause handles to be shared,
 *              but  passing it to  `unshare(2)' will cause  handles to be unshared.
 * @param: flags: Set of `CLONE_*' flags:
