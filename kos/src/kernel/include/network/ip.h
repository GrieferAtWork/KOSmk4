 * Or in other words, this function assumes that:
 * >> assert(nic_packet_headfree(packet) >= ETH_PACKET_HEADSIZE);
 * >> assert(nic_packet_tailfree(packet) >= ETH_PACKET_TAILSIZE);
 * - Additionally, the caller is responsible to ensure that the
 *   partially initialized IP header (i.e. `struct iphdr') is pointed
 *   to by `packet->np_head' upon entry, as this function will try
 *   to read/write from that structure in order to figure out addressing
 *   information required for filling in information for underlying
 *   network layers.
 * - NOTE: If necessary, this function will also perform the required
 *         ARP network traffic in order to translate the target IP
 *         address pointed to by the IP header of `packet'.
 *         This is done asynchronously, and transparently to the caller.
 * NOTE: This function automatically fills in the following fields of the IP header:
 *   - ip_v      (With the value `4')
 *   - ip_len    (With the value `nic_packet_size(packet)')
 *   - ip_id     (using `struct net_peeraddr::npa_ipgramid')
 *   - ip_off    (as required for fragmentation; the RF and DF flags are not overwritten!)
 *   - ip_sum    (Only if not done by hardware, then will be filled with the correct value)
 * With this in mind, the caller must have already filled in:
 *   - ip_hl     (header length divided by 4)
 *   - ip_tos    (Type of IP service)
 *   - ip_off.RF (Should already be cleared)
 *   - ip_off.DF (Don't-fragment flag)
 *   - ip_ttl    (Time to live)
 *   - ip_p      (IP Protocol; One of `IPPROTO_*')
 *   - ip_src    (Sender IP address (usually `dev->nd_addr.na_ip', or a broadcast IP))
 *   - ip_dst    (Target IP address) */
