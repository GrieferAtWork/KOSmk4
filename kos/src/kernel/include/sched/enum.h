 *          waits for this  function to  complete with  preemption
 *          disabled, the system will dead-lock
 * WARNING: This function can  only give  a "best-effort"  guaranty

 *          that move between CPUs during the call to this function
 *          may not  be listed,  and threads  that have  yet to  be
 *          started  aren't  listed, either.  Consequently,  it can
 *          also happen that a thread is enumerated more than once.
 * NOTE: Only use this function if it's OK to miss some thread, and
 *       for some threads to be listed  more than once. If it's  at
 *       all possible for  you to acquire  a lock to  `pidns_root',
