/* High-level RPC scheduling function.
 * This is the kernel-equivalent of the userspace `rpc_exec()' from <kos/rpc.h>
 *
 * @param: flags: Set of RPC flags (MUST contain `RPC_CONTEXT_KERN'):
 *   - RPC_CONTEXT_KERN:           Mandatory flag
 *   - RPC_CONTEXT_NOEXCEPT:       The given `func' never throws and may be served by `task_serve_nx()'
 *   - RPC_SYNCMODE_F_ALLOW_ASYNC: Schedule  as an asynchronous RPC (be _very_ careful about these, as
 *                                 the given `func' must act like an interrupt handler and be NOBLOCK)
 *   - RPC_SYNCMODE_F_USER:        Only  allowed  when  `!(thread->t_flags & TASK_FKERNTHREAD)':   Force
 *                                 unwind the current system call the next time `thread' makes a call to
 *                                 `task_serve()'  (if the thread is currently sleeping, it will be send
 *                                 a sporadic interrupt which should cause it to call that function once
 *                                 again). Once unwinding all to  way to userspace has finished,  invoke
 *                                 `func' in the context to which  the syscall returns. Note that  here,
 *                                 `func'  is allowed  to transition  the `ctx->rc_context'  it is given
 *                                 from `RPC_REASONCTX_SYSCALL' to `RPC_REASONCTX_SYSRET', in which case
 *                                 the system call/interrupt will not be restarted.
 *   - RPC_SYNCMODE_F_SYSRET:      May only be used when  combined with `RPC_SYNCMODE_F_USER', in  which
 *                                 case the RPC will only be invoked the next time that `thread' returns
 *                                 to user-space (or immediately if `thread' is currently in user-space)
 *                                 Note though that an in-progress, blocking system call isn't  aborted.
 *   - RPC_PRIORITY_F_HIGH:        When  `thread' is hosted by the same CPU as the caller, gift the rest
 *                                 of the calling thread's current quantum to `thread' and have it start
 *                                 executing even before this function returns.
 * @return: true:  Success
 * @return: false: Failure because `thread' has already terminated. */
