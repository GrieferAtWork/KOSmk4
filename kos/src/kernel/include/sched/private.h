/* Call a given `func' in a context such that thread-private variables of `thread'
 * can be read, and following variable-specific restrictions, may potentially also
 * be writable.
 * This is done by ensuring that `func' is run:
 *  - While preemption is disabled
 *  - From some arbitrary thread hosted by `thread->t_cpu' at the
 *    time that `func' is invoked (which is guarantied to not change
 *    because preemption is disabled)
 *    WARNING: When `func' is called, there is a possibility
 *             that `thread == THIS_TASK'
 * If `thread' is hosted by a different CPU, an IPI will be scheduled for execution
 * on said CPU. It is the allocation of a reference-counted control structure that
 * has to be shared with the target CPU in this scenario that may potentially fail
 * due to an allocation failure. Note that this control structure is required to
 * safely handle the case of the original thread getting interrupted such that this
 * function will return by throwing an `E_INTERRUPT' exception.
 * This function is most useful for accessing private registers caches of `thread'
 * from an arbitrary, different thread, such as the x86-specific `x86_get_irregs()'
 * @param: thread:    The thread who's private variables the caller wishes to access.
 * @param: func:      The function used to access `thread's private variables.
 * @param: stack_buf: A buffer of `bufsize' bytes that is allocated in the caller's kernel stack.
 *                    This buffer is passed to `func()' when `thread' is hosted by the caller's CPU.
 *                    When `thread' is hosted by a different CPU, a reference countered control
 *                    structure containing sufficient space for `bufsize' is allocated and pre-
 *                    initialized with the contents of `stack_buf'. Following this, an IPI is used
 *                    to invoke `func' in the context of `thread->t_cpu', whilst passing a pointer
 *                    to the memory-copy of this buffer to `func()', before the return of `func()'
 *                    will cause the original caller of `cpu_call_private_function()' to wake up,
 *                    at which the same pointer previously passed to `func()' is returned.
 *                    The caller must always clean up this pointer via a call to
 *                    `cpu_private_function_finibuf_ex()', which will free() a dynamically allocated
 *                    buffer, unless the buffer wasn't dynamically allocated.
 * @param: bufsize:   Size of `stack_buf'
 * @param: bufalign:  Alignment requirements of `stack_buf' */
