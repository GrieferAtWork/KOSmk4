/* A system call and ABI for a user-space-controlled sigprocmask()  using
 * this, user-space can  block/unblock signals without  having to do  any
 * system calls in the case where no signal arrived in the mean time, and
 * in  the case where a signal did arrive in the mean time, only 1 system
 * call (`sys_rpc_serve_sysret(2)') is required.
 *
 * Purpose:
 *    - A lot of kernel-space code makes use of `PREEMPTION_PUSHOFF()' / `PREEMPTION_POP()'
 *      in order to ensure reentrancy for small sections of code. The equivalent user-space
 *      API for this is `sigprocmask()', however that function is anything but efficient in
 *      what  it  does, having  to  unconditionally employ  a  system call  when  used, and
 *      furthermore, that system call isn't the fastest one out there, either.
 *    - Solve this problem by designing a sigprocmask() function that can be  implemented
 *      entirely within the confines of user-space (only needing to perform a system call
 *      in the scenario where a (potentially) pending signal has become unmask)
 *
 * Notes:
 *    - The race condition caused  by the thread exiting,  and its reaper destroying  the
 *      backing memory of the userprocmask structure is solved by merging this new system
 *      call with the exiting `set_tid_address(2)' API, which already solves this problem
 *      by  requiring that the backing storage of the  TID address may only be freed once
 *      the kernel has written `0' to the TID address.
 *    - The `pm_sigsize' field must not be changed  by user-space. The kernel only guaranties  that
 *      it will check that field once (during the initial call to `sys_set_userprocmask_address()')
 *      If the field is altered at  any point after that, the  kernel will most likely just  ignore
 *      that change, continuing to work under the assumption of the original value.
 *    - When the kernel needs to modify a thread's signal mask, this is handled by:
 *       - In the case of calling a signal handler with a non-empty `sigaction::sa_mask',
 *         the kernel will load the `pm_sigmask'  pointer, and or' the pointed-to  signal
 *         set  with `sigaction::sa_mask'. Note  though that this  could only happen when
 *         `*pm_sigmask'  contained any 0-bits before, meaning that an all-1s signal mask
 *         will never be modified in this case.
 *       - A call to the actual `sys_sigprocmask(2)' system call (_NOT_ the libc variant
 *         described further below).
 *         In this case, rather than modifying its own, original signal mask, the kernel
 *         will instead load the `pm_sigmask' point, and apply the same modifications it
 *         would  have applied to  the thread's internal  (kernel-space) signal mask the
 *         signal set pointed-to by user-space. In this case, the system call doesn't do
 *         anything  that couldn't already be implemented in user-space, but still works
 *         as expected for the sake of compatibility.
 *
 * Semantics:
 *
 *    - When  using  `sys_set_userprocmask_address(2)', the  pointed-to `struct userprocmask'
 *      structure must have  thread-local storage  duration (that  is: may  not be  destroyed
 *      until _after_  the thread  that called  `sys_set_userprocmask_address()' has  exited,
 *      or until another call to `sys_set_userprocmask_address(2)' that assigned a  different
 *      address, or disabled USERPROCMASK by passing NULL, or a call to `set_tid_address(2)',
 *      which also disables USERPROCMASK)
 *
 *    - Kernel-space  checks for is-signal-masked are only ever  performed in the context of the
 *      thread in question itself.  When some other  thread wishes to  know if a  userprocmask'd
 *      thread  is masking some signal, they must simply  assume that the thread isn't, and send
 *      an RPC that should confirm  this for them. This is  required, due to the indirection  of
 *      the `pm_sigmask' field, which allows user-space to switch between signal mask  pointers,
 *      rather than having  to copy around  signal sets as  a whole. Also,  this is required  to
 *      ensure  that modifications made  by libc's sigprocmask() are  applied atomically for all
 *      signals, rather than individually for each signal (which would result in race conditions
 *      when  unmasking  one signal  triggers a  signal handler  that would  get executed  in an
 *      inconsistent context)
 *      As such, user-space making use of userprocmask somewhat increases the overhead needed
 *      for raising signals, however given that  raising signals in general aren't  something
 *      done  by programs  with the intend  of using them  for performance-critical purposes,
 *      this is completely acceptable.
 *
 *    - During a (successful) call to exec(), userprocmask-mode is disabled, the same way it
 *      would  also be disabled from user-space calling `sys_set_userprocmask_address(NULL)'
 *      As such, the final contents of `pm_sigmask'  from the thread calling exec() will  be
 *      loaded into the kernel's internal (legacy) sigprocmask buffer, such that the  signal
 *      mask  itself is inherited by a new process  the same way it would be if userprocmask
 *      hadn't been using by the original process.
 *
 *    - During a call to fork() or clone() (w/o CLONE_VM), the parent thread's
 *      TASK_FUSERPROCMASK    attribute    is    inherited    unconditionally.
 *
 *    - During a call to clone(CLONE_VM), where the parent is a userprocmask  thread,
 *      prior to clone() returning in either the parent or child, the parent thread's
 *      user-space `pm_sigmask' is copied into  the kernel-space buffer of the  child
 *      thread, before the child thread will start with TASK_FUSERPROCMASK=0.
 *
 *    - During a vfork(2),  where the parent  thread has the  TASK_FUSERPROCMASK
 *      attribute set, the parent's process's `pm_sigmask' will be copied into a
 *      temporary kernel-space buffer prior to starting the child thread.  Then,
 *      until the child thread indicates that it has successfully called exec(2)
 *      or   _Exit(2),  the  parent  thread's  TASK_FUSERPROCMASK  attribute  is
 *      cleared, and the internal kernel-space signal  mask is set to block  all
 *      signals (except `SIGKILL' and `SIGSTOP'), thus mirroring the behavior of
 *      vfork() without userprocmask.
 *      The  child  thread is  started  with the  `TASK_FUSERPROCMASK'  attribute set,
 *      which will be cleared the normal way once the child performs a successful call
 *      to either exec(2) or  _Exit(2), at which pointer  the process will once  again
 *      wake up.
 *      Back in the parent process, the kernel will now perform 2 copy operations:
 *       - memcpy(orig_pm_sigmask, &saved_sigmask, sizeof(sigset_t));
 *       - THIS_USERPROCMASK_POINTER->pm_sigmask = orig_pm_sigmask;
 *      Where `THIS_USERPROCMASK_POINTER' is the pointer that the parent thread originally
 *      passed  to  `sys_set_userprocmask_address()', `orig_pm_sigmask'  was the  value of
 *      `THIS_USERPROCMASK_POINTER->pm_sigmask'  prior to the child process being started,
 *      and `saved_sigmask' were  the contents  of `*orig_pm_sigmask' prior  to the  child
 *      process being started.
 *
 *    - During  a  vfork(2),  where  the  parent  thread  didn't  have  then `TASK_FUSERPROCMASK'
 *      attribute  set, but the child process performs a call to `sys_set_userprocmask_address()'
 *      before eventually performing a successful call to exec(2) or exit(2), the parent thread's
 *      TLS state (which at this point is assumed  to be shared with the child process) is  fixed
 *      up to indicate that `sys_set_userprocmask_address()' had yet to be called in its context.
 *      This is done by having the vfork child do `THIS_USERPROCMASK_POINTER->pm_sigmask = NULL',
 *      thus indicating to the parent thread that `sys_set_userprocmask_address(2)' wasn't called
 *      yet.
 *      For this purpose, the kernel  sets a thread flag `TASK_FUSERPROCMASK_AFTER_VFORK'  when
 *      a call `sys_set_userprocmask_address(<not-NULL>)' is performed by a thread that doesn't
 *      already  have the `TASK_FUSERPROCMASK'  attribute set, but  does have the `TASK_FVFORK'
 *      attribute set.
 *
 *
 * Example code:
 * >> sigset_t os, ns;
 * >> sigfillset(&ns);
 * >> sigprocmask(SIG_SETMASK, &ns, &os);   // PREEMPTION_PUSHOFF()
 * >> ...
 * >> sigprocmask(SIG_SETMASK, &os, NULL);  // PREEMPTION_POP()
 *
 *

 * >>     pid_t     pm_mytid;    // [const] TID of the thread (same as `set_tid_address(2)')

 * >>                            // that contains a non-empty `sa_mask'.
