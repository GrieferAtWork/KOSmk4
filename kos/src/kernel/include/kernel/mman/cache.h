/* multi-thread-corrected version of `syscache_clear()'.
 * This function should always be used in favor of `syscache_clear()', as it
 * solves the scenario of multiple threads calling `syscache_clear()' at the
 * same time, in which case resources may only get freed by one thread, with
 * the other thread never getting informed about that fact.
 * In this case,  `syscache_clear()' would normally  (and correctly I  might
 * add) return `0' for some threads, since that thread really didn't release
 * any  resources. However,  the intended use  of this function  is inform a
 * caller who just  failed to  allocate some optional  resource, that  their
 * resource may have become available, and that they should try again (which
 * is  something that isn't fulfilled by the regular `syscache_clear()' in a
 * multi-threaded environment)
 *
 * That is where this function comes in:
 * >> void *my_alloc_tryhard() {
 * >>     void *result;
 * >>     result = my_alloc();
 * >>     if unlikely(!result) {
 * >>         syscache_version_t ver = SYSCACHE_VERSION_INIT;
 * >>         for (;;) {
 * >>             result = my_alloc();
 * >>             if (result)
 * >>                 break;
 * >>             if (!syscache_clear_s(&ver))
 * >>                 break;
 * >>         }
 * >>     }
 * >>     return result;
 * >> }
 *
 * @return: * : At  least  some amount  of  some kind  of  resource (may  have) been
 *              released by some thread since the last time the function was called.
 *              In  this  case  the  caller  should  re-attempt  whatever  lead them
 *              to try and clear caches to reclaim resource (usually memory)
 * @return: 0 : Nothing was released/freed.
