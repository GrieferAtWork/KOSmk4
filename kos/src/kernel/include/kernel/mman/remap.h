/* Remap an existing mapping at `old_address'.
 *  - The given `new_address' (if `MREMAP_FIXED' was given)
 *    must  have the same  in-page offset as `old_address'.
 *    s.a.  `E_INVALID_ARGUMENT_CONTEXT_MREMAP_NEW_ADDRESS'
 *  - The  given `old_address' is  floor-aligned to whole pages.
 *    The resulting addend is added to `old_size' (if non-zero),
 *    `new_size', as well as the eventual `return' value.
 *  - the given `old_size' is ceil-aligned to whole pages.
 *  - the given `new_size' is ceil-aligned to whole pages.
 * This function operates in 1 of 2 ways:
 *
 * if (old_size == 0):
 *     requires:
 *       - The `MREMAP_MAYMOVE' flag _must_ be set
 *       - The mnode at `old_address' must point to a non-anonymous mpart,
 *         and have the `MNODE_F_SHARED' flag set.
 *     action:
 *       - Create   another  memory  mapping  with  the  same  protection
 *         and  share  characteristics as  that from  `old_address', such
 *         that `return...+=new_size' is mapped, `return != old_address',
 *         and the  in-file offset  at `old_address'  equals the  in-file
 *         offset at `return'. Use  `MREMAP_FIXED' and other flags  so-as
 *         to choose where to put the new mapping.
 *       - The existing mapping is kept in this case.
 * else:
 *     requires:
 *       - `old_address...+=old_size' must point to some kind of uninterrupted
 *         mapping of a singular file (such that in-file offsets for all bytes
 *         from the given range map linearly to virtual addresses).
 *     action:
 *       - When `new_size <= old_size', unmap trailing pages. For this purpose,
 *         all  pages touched by `old_address...+=new_size' will remain mapped.
 *         When `MREMAP_FIXED'  is given,  all of  the remaining  mappings  are
 *         moved  over  to `new_address...+=new_size',  and  `new_address' will
 *         be returned. Otherwise, `old_address' will be re-returned.
 *       - When `new_size > old_size', allocate more mnode/mpart pairs to fill
 *         in the missing portion of the file mapping.
 *         When `MREMAP_FIXED' is given, move the (now larger) file mapping to
 *         that address, removing the  old mapping from `old_address',  before
 *         returning the mapping at `new_address'
 *         Otherwise,  check if the  missing portion can  simply be mapped above
 *         the existing mapping (`old_address+old_size...+=(new_size-old_size)')
 *         If it can, put it at that position. Otherwise, use `MREMAP_FIXED' and
 *         other flags to choose where to put the new mapping.
