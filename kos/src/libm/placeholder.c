/* libm doesn't actually do anything in KOS.
 * All of the math functions are already defined in libc (for compatibility with DOS),
 * so when libm is loaded,  attempting to dlsym() or simply  use one of the many  math
 * functions will cause `libdl.so' to walk the dependency tree of libm (which contains
 * libc.so), allowing it to find the implementations provided there.
 * We could in theory provide some linux/gnu-specific math functions here and keep them
 * out of libc, however given that this really isn't necessary, not doing anything here
 * works just as well. */
