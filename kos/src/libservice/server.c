/*
 * NOTE: Graceful client disconnect is done as follows:
 *  - Set a marker-flag that prevents the spawning of new client threads,
 *    as well as sleeping threads from consuming pending com descriptors.
 *  - Cancel all still-running service threads for the client.
 *    In turn, any active command completes with status SERVICE_COM_ST_ECHO,
 *    which  a connected client will interpret as the service having exited.
 *  - Once  no more threads  are running for the  purpose of serving client
 *    commands, (meaning that  nothing else is  still accessing the  client
 *    data area), simply close(2) the originally accept(2)'ed client socket
 *    and have the attached client do the rest of the work.
 *  - Cleanup all remaining data, including our primary SHM mapping.
 *
 * NOTE: Forced client disconnect (as the result of a HUP on the originally
 *       accept(2)'ed client socket) is done the same.
 *
 * FIXME: What  about ENOMEM resulting when trying to cancel the worker threads.
 *        As a matter of fact: this is a problem pthread_cancel() faces as well,
 *        but currently simply ignores as though it couldn't happen... */
