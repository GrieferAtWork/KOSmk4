/* For the  purpose of  being able  to  safely handle  exceptions the  same  way
 * loaded  modules  do, a  couple  of global  functions  that aren't  defined by
 * the  RTLD   driver  itself   need  to   be  provided   by  loaded   libraries
 * Note that  these  functions  are  only needed  when  thrown  exceptions  pass
 * through  functions  apart  of the  RTLD  core, meaning  that  when exceptions
 * aren't being  used  by the  hosted  application  or its  libraries,  or  even
 * if no exception is ever thrown from an __attribute__((constructor)) function,
 * these are never loaded. -  However, if they are,  then they must be  provided
 * by one of the loaded libraries (usually that library simply being  `libc.so')
 * If one of these functions  is used, but isn't provided  by any of the  loaded
 * modules, the hosted  application gets terminated  ungracefully, and an  error
 * message is written to the system log.
 * HINT: When  required,  the  functions  are  searched  for  the  same  way
 *       `dlsym(RTLD_DEFAULT, ...)' would search for them, following regular
 *       symbol  lookup  order  throughout all  globally  visible libraries.
 * NOTE: The behavior of these functions is specified and standardized in different
 *       places. - Search around the project and  on the Internet to find out  what
 *       each of these has to do, and how it has to do exactly that. */
