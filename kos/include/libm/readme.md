### Credits / Origin

I didn't implement this library. -- I just (painstakingly) ported it and rewrote everything to fit KOS coding/API conventions. (Filtering dependencies, extracting and unifying constants, escaping identifiers, changing everything to use IEEE types and related macros, ...)

As you might be able to guess, the implementation found here is derived from `fdlibm`

All credit regarding algorithms goes to the original author, and like with all differently licensed code, I present the end-product in this git as something falling under the combination of all relevant licenses. (Reminder: any changes I made to the original source material fall under KOS's (ZLib with Acknowledgement), referring to an imaginary `*.patch` file; the original material still remains licensed as it was, meaning that any use of the end-product must comply with all licenses related to the components it is derived from)
