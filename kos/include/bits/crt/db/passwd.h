/*
 * C structure for describing a password database entry from /etc/passwd
 *
 * Every line from /etc/passwd that isn't empty, or a comment will match
 * exactly one of the following formats:
 *
 *    pw_name:pw_passwd:pw_uid:pw_gid:pw_gecos:pw_dir:pw_shell
 *    pw_name:pw_passwd:pw_uid:pw_gid:pw_dir:pw_shell
 *    pw_name:pw_passwd:pw_uid:pw_gid
 *
 * NOTE: The `pw_passwd' field (used to be) the encrypted password for
 *       the user, though because /etc/passwd is readable by everyone,
 *       this was changed to make it harder to dump password hashes of
 *       user accounts. Nowadays, the actual password hashes are stored
 *       in /etc/shadow (which is only readable by the superuser), and
 *       in order to communicate this fact, `pw_passwd' is set to "x"
 *       Additionally, the following special values for `pw_passwd' exist:
 *  - "*":    No password has yet to be set (assign one with `passwd(1)')
 *  - "*NP*": A shadow record may be obtained from a NIS+ server.
 *  - "":     No password is needed
 *
 * For processing, libc uses `fparseln()' with default with `delim = "\0\0#"'
 *
 * FILES:
 *   - /etc/passwd
