/* Simple wrapper library for facilitating access to physical
 * memory from user-space. Note that in order to be able to
 * use this library, your program needs sufficient permissions
 * to be allowed to used /dev/mem
 *
 * NOTE: For simplicity, API functions do not include return values
 *       for the purpose of error checking. Instead, when physical
 *       memory access isn't possible, then API functions will instead
 *       leave `errno' as it was set by the underlying system call,
 *       which will usually be `EACCES' or `EPERM', and turn writes
 *       into no-ops, and reads into acting as though all physical
 *       memory was made up of 0-bytes.
 *       The only exception to this rule is `mmapphys', which will
 *       return with a permissions-error set.
 * Also note that upon success, none of the API functions will ever
 * modify `errno', meaning that you might also check for errors via:
 * >> errno = EOK;
 * >> pokephysl(0x12345, 42);
 * >> if (errno != EOK) {
 * >>     ...
 * >> } */
