__DECL_BEGIN

/* An key tree is a binary-tree based container designed
 * for extremely fast lookup to a mapping for any key.
 * Worst case lookup speed is O(31) on 32-bit and O(63) on 64-bit,
 * though available ram will severely reduce this number again,
 * with lookup speed also being affected by the amount of mapped
 * leafs/branches, as well as how they are mapped, as well as the
 * index of the least significant bit set in a given key.
 *
 * Also noteworthy is the fact that instead of mapping individual
 * addresses to unique leafs, an key tree maps regions of
 * addresses (so called key ranges/regions).
 * With that in mind, mapping an key range more than once
 * isn't allowed, causing either an error, or undefined behavior.
 *
 * An key tree follows strict ordering rules that enforce
 * a min-max mapping for every leaf that can be determined
 * by its associated addrsemi and addrlevel value.
 *
 * addrsemi:
 *   - The center point used as hint to plot the
 *     correct path for any mapped key.
 *   - Each time a branch is reached, the given pointer
 *     is checked to be located inside of its mapping.
 *     Only when it wasn't found, continue search as described below.
 *   Assuming 32-bit addresses, a path might be plotted like this:
 *     ADDR: 0x73400000
 *     LEVEL 31; SEMI 0x80000000 > 0x73400000 -> MIN (unset bit 31; set bit 30)
 *     LEVEL 30; SEMI 0x40000000 < 0x73400000 -> MAX (              set bit 29)
 *     LEVEL 29; SEMI 0x60000000 < 0x73400000 -> MAX (              set bit 28)
 *     LEVEL 28; SEMI 0x70000000 < 0x73400000 -> MAX (              set bit 27)
 *     LEVEL 27; SEMI 0x78000000 > 0x73400000 -> MIN (unset bit 27; set bit 26)
 *     LEVEL 26; SEMI 0x74000000 > 0x73400000 -> MIN (unset bit 26; set bit 25)
 *     LEVEL 25; SEMI 0x72000000 < 0x73400000 -> MAX (              set bit 24)
 *     LEVEL 24; SEMI 0x73000000 < 0x73400000 -> MAX (              set bit 23)
 *     LEVEL 23; SEMI 0x73800000 > 0x73400000 -> MIN (unset bit 23; set bit 22)
 *     LEVEL 22; SEMI 0x73400000 = 0x73400000 -> STOP SEARCH
 *   >> The key `0x73400000' can be mapped to 10 different leafes,
 *      with the worst case (here: failure) lookup time for this key
 *      always being O(10).
 *      Note though that for the lookup time to actually be 10, other mappings
 *      must exist that cover _all_ of the SEMI-values during all levels.
 *
 * addrlevel:
 *   - The index of the bit that was set for the current iteration.
 *   - Technically not required, as it can be calculated from addrsemi
 *     carrying this around still allows the addrtree to run faster:
 *     >> addrlevel = CTZ(addrsemi)   (CTZ = CountTrailingZeroes)
