/* Same as the regular unwind(3) (from libunwind.so), however (if configured),
 * this  one also handles the case where `absolute_pc' points into user-space,
 * allowing user-space text locations to be correctly unwound.
 * NOTE: This function should only be used when printing tracebacks for
 *       debugging purposes, but _NEVER_  for the purpose of  something
 *       like exception unwinding!
 * To improve the success-rate of unwinding, this function does a number of things:
 *   - Try to make use of the regular, old `unwind(3)' from `libunwind.so'
 *   - Make use of DWARF `.debug_frame' debug information (if present)
 *   - Inspect/emulate  the underlying program  text to detect patterns
 *     that lead to known return instructions. Though this is only done
 *     if implemented and supported for the hosting architecture.
 * Also note that in kernel-space, once the kernel has been poisoned, no
 * additional user-space module information can be loaded, and unwinding
 * for user-space location for which the kernel doesn't already know how
 * to unwind them will fail with `UNWIND_NO_FRAME'.
 * @return: * : One of `UNWIND_*' (UNWIND_SUCCESS on success, other values on failure) */
