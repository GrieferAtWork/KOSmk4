/* Generic scanf implementation
 * Taking a regular scanf-style format string and argument, these
 * functions will call the given `SCANNER' function which in
 * return should successively yield a character at a time from
 * some kind of input source.
 *  - If `SCANNER' returns `< 0', scanning aborts and that value is returned.
 *    Otherwise, the function returns the amount of successfully parsed arguments.
 *  - The user may use `SCANNER' to track the last read character to get
 *    additional information about what character caused the scan to fail.
 *  - The given `SCANNER' should also indicate EOF by returning `NUL'
 *  - This implementation supports the following extensions:
 *    - `%[A-Z]'   -- Character ranges in scan patterns
 *    - `%[^abc]'  -- Inversion of a scan pattern
 *    - `"\n"'     -- Skip any kind of linefeed (`"\n"', `"\r"', `"\r\n"')
 *    - `%$s'      -- `$'-modifier, available for any format outputting a string.
 *                    This modifier reads a `size_t' from the argument list,
 *                    that specifies the size of the following string buffer:
 *                 >> char buffer[64];
 *                 >> sscanf(data, "My name is %.?s\n", sizeof(buffer), buffer);
 * format -> %[*|?][width][length]specifier
 * @return: 0 :  No data could be scanned.
 * @return: * :  The total number of successfully scanned arguments.
 * @return: EOF: `PGETC' returned EOF the first time an attempt at reading was made */
