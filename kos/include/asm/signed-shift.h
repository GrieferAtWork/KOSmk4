/* Behavior of signed shift operations (`(-1 >> 1) == ???')
 *
 * The exact result of such an operation is arch-specific, but
 * for our purpose, we narrow down the range of  possibilities
 * to one of 3 options:
 *   #1: (-1 >> 1) == -1                --> Signed divide (most significant bit is copied)
 *   #2: (-1 >> 1) == 0x7fffffff[...]   --> Unsigned divide (most significant bit is set to `0')
 *   #3: (-1 >> 1) == ?                 --> Something entirely different.
 *
 * For these 3 cases, we define 0 or 1 of 2 macros:
 *   #1: #define __ARCH_SIGNED_SHIFT_IS_SDIV
 *   #2: #define __ARCH_SIGNED_SHIFT_IS_UDIV
 *   #3: Don't define anything.
