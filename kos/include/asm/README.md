### Public `<asm/foo.h>` headers

Normally, `<asm/...>` headers are all internal and not meant to be directly included by programs. However, a small hand full of headers fall out of this norm and are actually intended for direct inclusion. To prevent any confusion, the following are all of the official *public* asm-headers:

- `<asm/asmword.h>`
	- `.macro .word8`
	- `.macro .word16`
	- `.macro .word32`
	- `.macro .word64`
	- `.macro .wordptr`
	- `.macro .wordrel`
- `<asm/cacheline.h>`
	- `#define __ARCH_CACHELINESIZE <Integer>`
- `<asm/intrin.h>`
	- Arch-specific intrinsic functions
- `<asm/intrin-arith.h>`
	- Arch-specific intrinsic, arithmetic functions
- `<asm/page.h>` (not kos-specific, but rather an old (now-a-days removed) linux header)
	- `#define PAGE_MASK  <Integer>`
	- `#define PAGE_SIZE  <Integer>`
	- `#define PAGE_SHIFT <Integer>`
- `<asm/unistd.h>` (not kos-specific)
- `<asm/prctl.h>` (not kos-specific)

Some more headers also exist, but those are arch-specific (`<asm/cfi.h>`, `<asm/cpu-*.h>`, `<asm/intrin-*.h>`, `<asm/registers.h>`, ...)

Any other header may be renamed/deleted/added without warning, and as such are not part of the stable API. The same also goes for files which may be found in sub-folders. In any case, files not mentioned usually only contain escaped macros that get aliased to their unescaped counterparts by other, more appropriate headers. As such those other headers should always be included instead.
