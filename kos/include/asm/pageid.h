/* Convert  virtual memory addresses  to/form their compressed variants
 * in the form of Page-IDs, where  a Page-ID strips away any  redundant
 * address bits, as well as the unpagable lower `__ARCH_PAGESHIFT' bits
 * The  idea of this mechanism is to use it to define a special address
 * space  mechanism that can be used for encoding/decoding keys for use
 * with an address tree with the purpose of associating additional data
 * with specific addresses/address-ranges.
 * >> __ARCH_PAGEID_TYPE pageid  = __ARCH_PAGEID_ENCODE(addr);
 * >> void              *newaddr = __ARCH_PAGEID_DECODE(pageid);
 * Note that following  an encode+decode, the  resulting address is  always
 * floor-aligned  by a  multiple of  `__ARCH_PAGESIZE' (if  defined; if not
 * defined,  this mechanism is  unavailable), and may  not necessary be the
 * same as the floor-page-aligned value  of the original address, as  other
 * redundant  address may have  been stripped (an  example of this behavior
 * would be the  address-space sign-extension found  on x86_64  processors,
 * where these macros simply strip off redundant sign-bits during encoding,
 * but re-add then during decoding)
 * Additionally, the following constants are defined:
 *   - __ARCH_PAGEID_TYPE_SIZEOF: The size of `__ARCH_PAGEID_TYPE' in bytes
 *   - __ARCH_PAGEID_TYPE:        The smallest __UINTnn_TYPE__ such that `nn >= __ARCH_PAGEID_BITS'
 *   - __ARCH_PAGEID_BITS:        The number of bits used by a pageid (note that a pageid is always unsigned)
 *   - __ARCH_PAGEID_MAX:         The max possible page ID (`== (1 << __ARCH_PAGEID_BITS) - 1')
